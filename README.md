# StegnoRS
Yet another steganography toolkit

## What is this?
Take file, hide a message in it, send it to someone you'd fancied, extract the hidden message.

### TODO
#### Binary
* Add error handling to the binary
* Add usage prints

#### Library
* Make it possible to hide files rather than strings in other files
* Add support to more formats (WAV)
* Encapsulate better? 
    * Redesign prior to WAV support
